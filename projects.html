        <div class="project1"><span class="project_name">Vagabond Cafe</span><p>A text-base interactive story game made by myself. The player will play the role of a 50-year-old man with dementia, who visits a café every day at 11 a.m. to order two espressos and two croissants, waiting for someone. You say that your wife once promised to meet you here. The café has different customers every day, tourists and backpackers traveling to this ancient city, who occasionally chat with you.</p></div>
        <div class="project2"><span class="project_name">Space Invaders</span><p>A basic classic arcade game made by myself where players defend Earth from descending alien invaders. Move and shoot to destroy aliens, avoiding their attacks. </p></div>
        <div class="project3"><span class="project_name">Pong Game</span><p>A basic old game made by myself where two players control paddles, bouncing a ball back and forth.</p></div>
